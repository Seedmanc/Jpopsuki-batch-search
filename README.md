# Jpopsuki-batch-search
Search releases by a list of lookup queries at once

The [userscript](https://github.com/Seedmanc/Jpopsuki-batch-search/blob/master/jpopsuki-batch-search.user.js) adds a link to the batch search page next to the lookup fields like this:

The search page allows you to enter a list of queries, optionally separating the release title from the performer name by a tab character (useful when copy-pasting from TV channel pages that provide a list of PVs). You can also choose which torrent category to search in.

Sorting by title and name is supported. After searching finishes, you're presented with both the list of found releases and the list of missing ones in case you wanted to find the potential candidates for uploading.
